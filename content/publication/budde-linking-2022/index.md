abstract: "Purpose The available questionnaires for quality-of-life (QoL) assessments\
  \ are age-group specific, limiting comparability and impeding longitudinal analyses.\
  \ The comparability of measurements, however, is a necessary condition for gaining\
  \ scientific evidence. To overcome this problem, we assessed the viability of harmonising\
  \ data from paediatric and adult patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. Method\
  \ To this end, we linked physical functioning scores from the Paediatric Quality\
  \ of Life Inventory (PedsQL) and the Paediatric Quality of Life Questionnaire (PEDQOL)\
  \ to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Questionnaire\
  \ (EORTC QLQ-C30) for adults. Samples from the EURAMOS-1 QoL sub-study of 75 (PedsQL)\
  \ and 112 (PEDQOL) adolescent osteosarcoma patients were concurrently administered\
  \ both paediatric and adult questionnaires on 98 (PedsQL) and 156 (PEDQOL) occasions.\
  \ We identified corresponding scores using the single-group equipercentile linking\
  \ method. Results Linked physical functioning scores showed sufficient concordance\
  \ to the EORTC QLQ-C30: Lin's ρ = 0.74 (PedsQL) and Lin's ρ = 0.64 (PEDQOL). Conclusion\
  \ Score linking provides clinicians and researchers with a common metric for assessing\
  \ QoL with PRO measures across the entire lifespan of patients."
