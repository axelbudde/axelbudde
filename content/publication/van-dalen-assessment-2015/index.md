abstract: "To reduce alcohol related harm a wide range of interventions have been developed and brought together including in EU-funded projects. Nevertheless public health policy planners lack easy access to well described interventions that are replicable and about which reasonable evidence of effectiveness in influencing drinking attitudes or behaviours are available. Joint Action on Reducing Alcohol Related Harm is an initiative under the EU health programme to take forward the work in line with the first EU Strategy on alcohol related harm. The work is carried out through a cooperation by expert organisations from 31 European countries. RARHA’s Work Package 6 aims to present a Tool Kit of interventions that have demonstrated their effectiveness, transferability and relevance."
