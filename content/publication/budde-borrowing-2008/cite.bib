 abstract = {We introduce a novel empirical method that quantifies indirect temporal connectivity at airport hubs and overcomes certain limitations of existing methodology. Employing a pattern recognition algorithm, originally developed for behavioural research, we analysed schedules at Frankfurt and London Stansted airports in 2007. By employing our model in a comparative analysis, we demonstrate schedule coordination effects.},
