abstract: We introduce a novel empirical method that quantifies indirect temporal
  connectivity at airport hubs and overcomes certain limitations of existing methodology.
  Employing a pattern recognition algorithm, originally developed for behavioural
  research, we analysed schedules at Frankfurt and London Stansted airports in 2007.
  By employing our model in a comparative analysis, we demonstrate schedule coordination
  effects.
