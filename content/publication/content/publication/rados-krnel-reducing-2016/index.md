abstract: "Joint Action on Reducing Alcohol Related Harm is an initiative under the EU health programme to take forward the work in line with the first EU Strategy on alcohol related harm. The work is carried out through a cooperation by expert organisations from 32 European countries. RARHA’s Work Package 6 aims to present a Tool Kit of interventions that have demonstrated their effectiveness, transferability and relevance.In the communication with MS representatives and WP 6 partners we decided to collect the examples of good practices appertain to one of the three groups of interventions: Early interventions, Public awareness and School-based interventions. Using RARHA’s network and CNAPA we have searched for professionals experienced in alcohol related interventions, with a good overview and knowledge on interventions in their country, to provide reliable data at country level. In order to assess the collected examples we have developed the Assessment criteria based on an existing Dutch system for evaluating health-based interventions. The interventions were assessed based on the following criteria: a. Intervention is well described, b. Intervention is implemented in the real world/feasible/transferable, c. Intervention has a theoretical base and d. Intervention has been evaluated. There are four levels of evidence-based depending on the design of the studies that were looking into the effects of the intervention."
